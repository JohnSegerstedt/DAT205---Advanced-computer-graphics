# DAT205 - Advanced-computer-graphics
The final demo project in Advanced Computer Graphics by John Segerstedt.
The demo features:
* *Particle System* - Both for simple pixel particles and for blending textures together to simulate jet engine exhaustion.
* *Collision System* - Implemented a uniform grid spatial data structure to speed up collision detection. The implementation was able to limited to 2D space but could handle any sized objects.
* *Simple Game Logic* - Implemented a very basic gameplay loop of enemy asteroids spawning in waves and being sent towards the player.

NOTE: A small portion of the OpenGL code base was given in the course.
